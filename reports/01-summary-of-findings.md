# Summary of Findings

## Introduction

The analysis of the patient health dataset aimed to explore the characteristics of patients, their diagnoses, and the factors influencing missed appointments. The dataset contains information on patients including their:

- `PatientID`
- `Age`
- `Gender`
- `Diagnosis`
- `AppointmentDate`
- `Outcome`
- `GPPractice`
- `MissedAppointment`

The analysis involved data visualization, statistical calculations, and data preparation to gain insights into the dataset. This summary provides an overview of the key findings from the analysis.

## Dataset Overview

The dataset contains 5000 entries with 8 columns. The columns include `PatientID`, `Age`, `Gender`, `Diagnosis`, `AppointmentDate`, `Outcome`, `GPPractice`, and `MissedAppointment`. The dataset was explored to understand the distribution of data and identify any missing values.

## Missing Values

The dataset contains missing values in several columns. The missing values were visualized using a bar plot and a heatmap to identify the columns with missing data. The `Age` and `Gender` columns each have 3 missing values, `Diagnosis` has 1 missing value, `AppointmentDate` has 2 missing values, and `Outcome` has 2 missing values.

## Age Distribution

The age distribution of patients was visualized using a histogram with a KDE plot. The distribution shows a wide range of ages among the patients, with the majority of patients falling between the ages of 20 and 60.

## No-Show Rates

The no-show rates were calculated and visualized for different diagnoses and GP practices. The analysis revealed that `Asthma` has the highest no-show rate at approximately 51.4%, followed by `Hypertension` and `Diabetes`. Among GP practices, `D012` has the highest no-show rate at approximately 57.2%, while `E345` has the lowest at approximately
43.8%. The no-show rates were visualized using
bar plots.

## Gender Distribution

The gender distribution per diagnosis was visualized using a stacked bar plot. The distribution shows a relatively balanced number of male and female patients across different diagnoses.

## Data Preparation

The dataset was prepared for further analysis by selecting relevant features and handling missing values. The missing values were filled with the mode for categorical variables and the mean for numerical variables. Categorical variables were encoded using one-hot encoding to prepare the dataset for modeling.

## Conclusion

The analysis of the patient health dataset provided insights into the patient demographics, no-show rates, and the distribution of various attributes in the dataset. The findings can be used to understand the factors influencing missed appointments and to develop strategies to reduce no-show rates. Further analysis and modeling can be performed to explore the relationships between different variables and predict missed appointments based on patient characteristics.

In summary, the key findings from the analysis include:

1. **Missing Values**:
    - The dataset contains missing values in the `Age`, `Gender`, `Diagnosis`, `AppointmentDate`, and `Outcome` columns.
2. **Age Distribution**:
    - The age distribution of patients shows a wide range of ages, with the majority of patients falling between the ages of 20 and 60.
3. **No-Show Rates**:
    - The no-show rates vary across different diagnoses and GP practices, with `Asthma` having the highest no-show rate and `E345` having the lowest.

The insights gained from this analysis can be used to improve patient engagement and reduce missed appointments in healthcare settings. Further analysis and modeling can provide more detailed insights and predictive capabilities to address the challenges of missed appointments in healthcare.

The analysis of the patient health dataset provides a foundation for future research and decision-making in healthcare management and patient care. The findings can be used to develop targeted interventions and strategies to improve patient outcomes and optimize healthcare services.
